# Homework 1 - Chong Chen

## 1. Find a collision in each of the hash functions below:

### 1.1. H(x) = $x^2 \mod 9$, where $x$ can be any integer

**Answer**:
Let $x_1 = 9$ and $x_2 = 18$. Then:
\[
H(x_1) = H(x_2) = 0
\]

### 1.2. H(x) = number of 0-bits in $x$, where $x$ can be any bit string

**Answer**:
Let $x_1 = \text{"10011"}$ and $x_2 = \text{"010111"}$. Then:
\[
H(x_1) = H(x_2) = 2
\]

### 1.3. H(x) = the three least significant bits of $x$, where $x$ is a 32-bit integer

**Answer**:
Let $x_1 = 1$ and $x_2 = 1 + 2^{30} = 1073741825$. Then:
\[
H(x_1) = H(x_2) = 1
\]

## 2. Implement a program to find an $x$ such that $H(x \circ \text{id}) \in Y$ where:

1. $H$ = SHA-256
2. \( \text{id} = \text{0xED00AF5F774E4135E7746419FEB65DE8AE17D6950C95CEC3891070FBB5B03C78} \)
3. $Y$ is the set of all 256-bit values that have some byte with the value \( 0x2F \).
4. Assume SHA-256 is puzzle-friendly.

Your answer for $x$ must be in hexadecimal.

### Rust Code [https://github.com/chongchen1999/INFO7500-cryptocurrency/blob/main/hw1/find_x/src/main.rs]:
```rust
use hex;
use rand::Rng;
use sha2::{Digest, Sha256};

fn main() {
    let id_hex_string = "ED00AF5F774E4135E7746419FEB65DE8AE17D6950C95CEC3891070FBB5B03C78";
    const TARGET_BYTE: u8 = 0x2F;

    let id_hex = hex::decode(id_hex_string).expect("Failed to decode hexadecimal string");
    let mut rng = rand::thread_rng();

    loop {
        // Generate a random 32-byte array
        let mut random_bytes = [0u8; 32];
        rng.fill(&mut random_bytes);

        // Concatenate the random bytes and the ID
        let mut concatenated_input = random_bytes.to_vec();
        concatenated_input.extend_from_slice(&id_hex);

        // Compute the SHA-256 hash of the concatenated input
        let hash_result = Sha256::digest(&concatenated_input);

        // Check if the hash contains the target byte
        if hash_result.contains(&TARGET_BYTE) {
            let random_bytes_hex = hex::encode(random_bytes).to_uppercase();
            println!("Found matching x: {}", random_bytes_hex);
            break;
        }
    }
}
```

### Dependencies
   ```toml
   [dependencies]
   sha2 = "0.10"
   rand = "0.8"
   hex = "0.4"
   ```

### One Solution:
\( \text{x} = \text{F4D4520CE652631AB2937DE847BA4B539BBA270591A1D30BAFED72E4685890E7} \)

## 3. Protocol for Playing Rock-Paper-Scissors Over SMS

### 3.1. Protocol Preparation
Both players need to:
- Agree on a secure hash function, such as SHA-256.
- Have the ability to generate a secret number that cannot be known by others.

### 3.2. Game Process

#### Alice's Operations:
1. Alice generates a secret number $n_A$ and selects her gesture (rock, paper, or scissors), denoted as $g_A$.
2. Combine the secret number $n_A$ and the gesture $g_A$ into a string $s_A = \text{str}(n_A) + \text{str}(g_A)$.
3. Calculate the hash value of the string $s_A$: $h_A = \text{hash}(s_A)$.
4. Alice sends the hash value $h_A$ to Bob.

#### Bob's Operations:
1. Bob generates a secret number $n_B$ and selects his gesture $g_B$.
2. Combine the secret number $n_B$ and the gesture $g_B$ into a string $s_B = \text{str}(n_B) + \text{str}(g_B)$.
3. Calculate the hash value of the string $s_B$: $h_B = \text{hash}(s_B)$.
4. Bob sends the hash value $h_B$ to Alice.

#### Exchange of Original Data:
1. Alice sends $n_A$ and $g_A$ to Bob after receiving $h_B$.
2. Bob sends $n_B$ and $g_B$ to Alice after receiving $h_A$.

#### Verification:
1. After receiving $n_A$ and $g_A$, Bob calculates $s_A' = \text{str}(n_A) + \text{str}(g_A)$ and verifies whether $\text{hash}(s_A') = h_A$. If they are equal, it confirms Alice has not cheated.
2. Similarly, after receiving $n_B$ and $g_B$, Alice calculates $s_B' = \text{str}(n_B) + \text{str}(g_B)$ and verifies whether $\text{hash}(s_B') = h_B$. If they are equal, it confirms Bob has not cheated.

### 3.3. Result Determination:
- Both players determine the game result according to the real gestures sent by the other, following the rules of "rock-paper-scissors."

### 3.4. Anti-Cheating Principle:
Each person reveals the secret number and gesture after receiving the hash value from the other person. That means when one person, let's say Alice, receives the secret number and gesture of Bob, her own hash value of the concatenated string of secret number and gesture has already been received by Bob. If she wants to cheat at this point, for example, change $g_A$ to $g_A'$, she must find a number $n_A'$ such that:
\[
\text{Hash}(\text{str}(n_A') + \text{str}(g_A')) = \text{Hash}(\text{str}(n_A) + \text{str}(g_A))
\]
This is infeasible because of the puzzle-friendliness property of the cryptographic hash function.
